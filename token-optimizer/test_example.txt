Please could you help me understand the repository configuration? I would like to know about the development environment setup, including the authentication and authorization requirements. 

The application seems to have multiple environments - development, staging, and production. Can you provide information about the database configurations for each environment?

I am particularly interested in understanding:
- The repository structure and organization
- Environment variables and configurations
- Authentication mechanisms and certificate management  
- How to initialize the development environment
- Database connection parameters and specifications

Additionally, it would be very helpful if you could explain the dependency management process and the requirements for setting up the application locally.

Thank you very much for your assistance!
