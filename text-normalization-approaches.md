# Text Normalization Approaches for Token Optimization

## Overview
The goal is to reduce token count in prompts while maintaining semantic meaning. Here are all possible approaches, from simple to sophisticated.

## 1. Rule-Based Approaches (No ML Required)

### A. Simple Pattern Replacement
- **How it works**: Hardcoded rules to replace common verbose patterns
- **Pros**: Fast, deterministic, no dependencies
- **Cons**: Limited coverage, manual maintenance
- **Example**: "in order to" → "to"

### B. Regex-Based Stripping
- **How it works**: Remove unnecessary text patterns (signatures, disclaimers, etc.)
- **Pros**: Very fast, good for known patterns
- **Cons**: Can accidentally remove important content
- **Tools**: Built-in regex libraries

## 2. Dictionary/Corpus-Based Approaches

### A. Abbreviation Dictionaries
- **How it works**: Map long forms to standard abbreviations
- **Pros**: Industry-standard abbreviations, reversible
- **Cons**: Domain-specific, needs curation
- **Resources**: 
  - SPECIALIST Lexicon (NIH)
  - Domain-specific abbreviation corpora
  - Wikipedia abbreviation lists

### B. Frequency-Based Replacement
- **How it works**: Replace rare words with common synonyms (better tokenization)
- **Pros**: Improves tokenization efficiency
- **Cons**: May lose nuance
- **Libraries**: 
  - NLTK with WordNet
  - spaCy with word vectors
  - Gensim for word2vec similarities

## 3. Tokenizer-Aware Approaches

### A. Token Counting Optimization
- **How it works**: Actually count tokens before/after replacement using the target model's tokenizer
- **Pros**: Accurate optimization for specific models
- **Cons**: Slower, model-specific
- **Implementation**:
  ```python
  from transformers import AutoTokenizer
  tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('gpt2')
  # Compare token counts for different phrasings
  ```

### B. Subword-Aware Compression
- **How it works**: Understand how tokenizers split words and optimize accordingly
- **Pros**: Highly efficient for specific tokenizers
- **Cons**: Very model-specific
- **Key insight**: "unbelievable" might be 3 tokens while "hard to believe" is 4

## 4. ML-Based Paraphrasing

### A. Small Paraphrasing Models
- **How it works**: Use small models trained specifically for concise paraphrasing
- **Pros**: Maintains meaning while reducing length
- **Cons**: Requires GPU, potential meaning drift
- **Models**:
  - **Pegasus Paraphrase** (568M params)
  - **T5-small for paraphrasing** (60M params)
  - **BART-base paraphrase** (139M params)

### B. Distilled Compression Models
- **How it works**: Models specifically trained to compress text
- **Pros**: Purpose-built for compression
- **Cons**: Limited availability
- **Options**:
  - **mT5-small** fine-tuned for summarization
  - Custom DistilBERT models for compression

## 5. Specialized Compression Models

### A. LLM Lingua (Microsoft Research)
- **How it works**: Specifically designed for prompt compression
- **Pros**: State-of-the-art compression rates
- **Cons**: Complex setup
- **Link**: https://github.com/microsoft/LLMLingua

### B. Prompt Compression via Reinforcement Learning
- **How it works**: RL-trained models that learn to compress while maintaining task performance
- **Pros**: Optimal compression for specific tasks
- **Cons**: Requires training data

## 6. Hybrid Approaches

### A. Pipeline Combination
```
Input → Spell Check → Abbreviations → Token-aware replacements → ML paraphrasing → Output
```

### B. Cascading Fallbacks
1. Try rule-based first (fastest)
2. If not enough reduction, try ML paraphrasing
3. If still too long, use summarization

## 7. Advanced Research Approaches

### A. Discrete Prompt Compression
- **Papers**: "Discrete Prompt Compression with Reinforcement Learning"
- **How**: Learn discrete token mappings

### B. Gradient-based Token Pruning
- **Papers**: "Compressing Prompts by Gradient-based Token Pruning"
- **How**: Use gradients to identify removable tokens

## Recommendation Decision Tree

```
Is latency critical (< 50ms)?
├─ Yes → Use rule-based + tokenizer-aware dictionary
└─ No → Is accuracy critical?
    ├─ Yes → Use LLMLingua or similar specialized model
    └─ No → Is it domain-specific?
        ├─ Yes → Train small custom model
        └─ No → Use Pegasus/T5 paraphrasing
```

## Quick Start Recommendations

1. **For immediate implementation**: Tokenizer-aware dictionary with common replacements
2. **For best compression**: LLMLingua or similar specialized tools
3. **For balance**: Pipeline with rules → abbreviations → small paraphrasing model
